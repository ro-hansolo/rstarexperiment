" 1. First, we need to determine the duration of the candle burning which is from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. To do that, we'll convert this time frame into hours.
           1:00 PM to 2:00 PM - 1 hour (60 minutes)

" 1. First, we need to determine the duration of time between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM. We know that there are 24 hours in a day, so we can calculate the difference in hours by subtracting one time from the other.
           5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours
        Since there's 1 hour in each of these 4 hours, a candle will melt for 2 centimeters * 4 hours = 8 centimeters per day when it burns from",Node4,1,0,1,1,0.8691113210176971,120,False
