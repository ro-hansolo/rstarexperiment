[\"1. Let's break down the information we have. In the 15-minute window, some of the cars drive through which means that number of cars equals to the total number of cars (30) minus the remaining number of cars (25) after those 15 minutes passed. So, the first group of cars that drove through is: (30 - 25) = 5 cars.\n        2. These 5 cars represent the ones\", 99, 0.9257588781961438]
