" 1. First, we need to know the distance covered by each train daily on their respective routes. 
          - Day 1 (Westward): They both travel for 80 miles.
           - Day 2 (Northwards): They both cover 150 miles.
       
        2. Next, we need to find out the combined distance traveled by each train on their two-day journey. To do this, sum up the daily distances from days 1 and 2.
          - Combined Distance = Day 1 Distance",Node1,4,7,4,11,0.7931952431261469,117,False
