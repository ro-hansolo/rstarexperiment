" 1. To find the total number of units in the entire building, first multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. This gives us 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.",Node0,0,8,0,8,0.616133868787331,51,False
" 1. We know that there are 15 floors in the building.
        2. Each floor has 8 units, so we calculate the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor (15 * 8 = 120).
        3. We're given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of the units are unoccupied.

" 1. First, let's find out how many units are in the entire building. There are 15 floors with 8 units each, so we multiply 15 by 8 to get the total number of units: 15 * 8 = 120 units.
