['1. We know that each 16-ounce can has 3 tomatoes and the sauce volume is 32 ounces.\n        2. To find out how many cans are needed, we need to divide the sauce volume by the volume of one can.

Now that we know how much is lost per can, let's find out how many cans were needed to make the desired sauce volume of 32 ounces.
