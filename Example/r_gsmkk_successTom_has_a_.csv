Since the order doesn't matter in choosing two marbles (red and green are the same as green and red), we can use combinations formula which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n- 4.

Now, to find different groups of two marbles from these marbles, we need to select two at a time. We will have combinations that can be made by picking one each from the colored marbles (red, green 3. Next, we have three yellow marbles. To choose two from them, we have 3C2 which means selecting two out of the three with ordering not mattering. This gives us the combination 4C1 * 3C2 = 4 * 3 = 12 different groups of two marbles where one is from each colored group and the other comes from the yellow marbles group. 4. Finally, we should also consider the case when both marbles are from the same color group. For red, there's only one way to pick two (both are red).
