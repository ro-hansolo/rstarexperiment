          So, there are 5 blue ties and twice that number of red ties, which is 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.
        4. Now, we need to determine the cost of red ties. We know that 5. The cost difference between red and blue ties is given as 50%, so if a blue tie costs $40, then a red tie will cost 50% more than that: Red tie cost = $40 + (50/100) * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60
        6. Finally, to find out the total amount spent on ties, we add up the costs of both blue and red ties: Total amount spent = Cost of",Node46,2,1,4,5,0.33710024825402596,107,False
" 1. We know that John bought twice as many red ties compared to the number of blue ties. Let's denote the number of blue ties as 'B'. Therefore, the number of red ties will be 2 * B.
        2. The cost difference between red and blue ties is given as 50% 3. We are given that John spent $200 on blue ties at a price of $40 each. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we can divide the total amount spent by the unit price: B = $200 / $40
          B = 5
          So, there are 5 blue ties and twice that number of red ties, which is 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.
        4. Now, we need to determine the cost of red ties. We know that - Each blue tie costs $40
         - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties
         - Therefore, each red tie costs (1 + 0.5) * $40 = 1.5 * $40 = $60
        5. Since John bought 10 red ties, the total amount spent on red ties can be calculated as: Red ties cost",Node47,1,1,3,4,0.5829505537627241,84,False

         b. The unit price for blue ties is $40.
