" 1. Let's identify the distances of each part of the trip. The total distance is 60 miles, and we have two stops at 20 miles and another one 15 miles from the end (which means it is also 15 miles before the end).
        2. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to calculate the remaining distance after the first stop until the second stop. The total distance is the sum of each part's distances: 60 = 20 + ?",Node4,3,3,3,6,0.6639636088672844,111,False

The total distance is the sum of each part's distances: 60 = 20 + ? 3. We know that the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip. To find its position relative to the starting point, we need to subtract this from the total distance (since it is 15 miles closer to the starting point than the end): 60 - 15 = 45 miles

To find the remaining distance, we can subtract the known distances: 60 - 20 = 40 miles left between the stops after the first one.
        4. Now, there are still two unknown parts of the trip (the last part before the second stop and the last 15 miles). To find this distance, we can subtract the known distances from what's left: 40 -",Node12,2,7,5,12,0.6633157243870332,120,False
