" 1. Let's analyze the given information.
        - John covers 60 miles in a week.
        - He runs 3 times per week, with different running durations each day (different hours).
          - First day, he runs for 3 hours.
          - Other two days, he runs half of what he did on the first day, which is 3/2 hours.

        2. We need to find how fast he runs per mile",Node1,2,3,2,5,0.983935881116908,101,False
" 1. First, let's find out how many miles John runs per day on average. To do this, we need to divide his total weekly mileage by the number of days he runs in a week. So, 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day (on average).",Node2,4,7,4,11,0.16461138354796756,64,False
" 1. First, let's find out how many hours John spends running in total per week.
           Total hours = Hours on first day + (Hours on second day / 2) + (Hours on third day / 2)
           Total hours = 3 + (3 / 2) + (3 / 2)
           Total hours = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
           Total hours = 6
