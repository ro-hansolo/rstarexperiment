['1. To find out how many miles Henry traveled between the first and second stops, we need to consider the total distance of his bike trip (60 miles), which includes the distances from the first stop to the second stop (15 miles) and from the end point back to the beginning of his journey. \n        2.

[\"1. First, let's determine the distance Henry traveled from the first stop to the second stop. He made a total of two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. His first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip (which means it was at 45 miles).\n        2. Now, let's calculate the distance between these two points.
