[\"1. Let's first determine how much laundry David does: Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can rewrite that relationship as follows - David's laundry = (Sarah's laundry) / 4. We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. So, David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.\", 85, 0.7106363135512272]

[\"1. We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.\n        2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so we can represent this relationship as: Sarah's laundry = 4 * David's laundry.\n        3. If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, then his laundry will be equal to: Raymond's laundry = (1/2) * Sarah's laundry.\n        4.

[\"1. First, let's find out how much laundry Sarah does compared to David by dividing her amount (400 pounds) by the ratio (David's laundry is 1/4th of Sarah's). This can be done as follows: 400 / (1/4) = 40\", 68, 0.7703043585694633]

So, we need to find out how many pounds of laundry David does in order to have the same amount as Sarah's. To do this, divide Sarah's 400 pounds by 4: 400 / 4 = 100 pounds (David does 100 pounds of laundry).\n        4. Raymond does\", 108, 0.6634498500542143]

So, Raymond's laundry = (Sarah's laundry) / 2 = (400) / 2 = 200 pounds.\n        3.
