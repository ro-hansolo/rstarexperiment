" 1. We know that Greg's alarm rings three times daily. Since there are three instances today, we'll consider these three timings individually.
        2. For the first timing, it rang four times instead of the usual three. This means an additional one ringing compared to its default setting.
        3. The second timing had a duration that was three times as long as the first time. If the first time took 1 hour (4 rings), then the second time took 3 hours (3 * 1 = 3 hours).",Node0,2,9,2,11,0.739367353304681,114,False
