" 1. First, we need to find out the total cost for both high heels. Since one pair costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, it will be $33 * 2 = $66.
        2. Now, the total cost of both heels together is $66, which is five dollars less than the boots. To find",Node0,1,5,1,6,0.8149626942872736,76,False
" 1. Let's denote the cost of the first pair of high heels as H1, the second pair of high heels as H2, and the cost of the boots as B.
        2. We know that H1 + H2 = B - $5 (since they together cost five dollars less than the boots).
        3. H2 is twice the cost of H1, so H2 = 2 * H1.

        4. Now we have the total cost for both pairs of heels: $33 + $66 = $99 5. We want to find out how many dollars the boots are worth. To do this, we need to subtract the combined cost of the two pairs of high heels from the boots' price. So, the difference is: Boots' price - ($99) = (Boots' price) - $99
